# FAST.Farm
Functions to either read or plot FAST.Farm files.

readfile_VTK.py: 
Takes absolute path to a .vtk file generated by FAST.Farm as input along with domain dimensions to give scaled axes and wind velocities as outputs.
Can then easily visualize the wind field with matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh
